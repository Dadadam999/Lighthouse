Lighthouse Simulation Project
Three lighthouses stand on the shore. 
The first one turns on for three seconds, then turns off for three seconds. 
The second one turns on for four seconds, then turns off for four seconds. 
The third one turns on for five seconds, then turns off for five seconds. 
All three lighthouses start operating simultaneously. How many minutes will pass from the start of operation until all three lighthouses turn on again at the same time?
